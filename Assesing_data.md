### Lesson2. Lesson Outline
Data wrangling process:
> - Gather
> - Assess (this lesson)
> - Clean

Assessing your data is the second step in data wrangling. When assessing, you're like a detective at work, <br>
inspecting your dataset for two things: data quality issues (i.e. content issues) and lack of tidiness (i.e. structural issues).<br>
Assessing is the precursor to cleaning. You can't clean something that you don't know exists! <br>
In this lesson, you'll learn to identify and categorize common data quality and tidiness issues. <br>
This lesson is the shortest and most "hands-off" code-wise of all four in the course <br>
because of the passive nature of assessing relative to gathering and cleaning. <br>
We have tried to include quizzes wherever possible.<br>

This lesson will be structured as follows:
>1. You'll get motivated to assess (and later clean) the dataset for lessons 3 and 4: 
   Phase II clinical trial data that compares the efficacy and safety of a new oral insulin to treat diabetes
> 2. You'll learn to distinguish between dirty data and messy data
> 3. You'll assess the data visually and programmatically to identify:
- Data quality issues
- Tidiness issues
> You'll learn about data quality dimensions and categorize each of the data quality issues 
> identified above into its appropriate dimension


### Lesson5. Unclean Data: Dirty vs. Messy

There are two types of unclean data:
> - Dirty data, also known as low quality data. Low quality data has content issues.
> - Messy data, also known as untidy data. Untidy data has structural issues.

In this lesson, you are going to assess both dirty and messy data. <br>
> - Your job right now is to start to distinguish between those two now, <br>
> - even though quality and tidiness (the latter, especially) may not be 100% solidified in your mind yet.
> - Answer the following quizzes, distinguishing between low quality and untidy data, to set yourself up for success in this lesson.

> Note: the data pictured in the animation is a simplified version of the actual dataset used in this lesson.
